# MATLAB-WRF
MATLAB scripts to read WRF outputs (netcdf files)

In this experiment we use WRF to model the temperature in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). The baseline year (2011) was modeled using land use data from INEGI serie VI, whereas the forecasted year (2060) was modeled using the ouput from the urban growth model SLEUTH (which is also based on the land use data from INEGI). 

The simulation period was from June 1st to June 28th with 6 days of spinup. 

The scripts here focus on extracting the temperature variable (T2) from WRF outputs.
The netcdf files are one observation each (1 hour).
